# State-Data
### This program creates a list of the U.S. states and using a user driven menu, sorts and displays the capital, population, and state flower of each state in the list.
The user can use the menu to display all the states and their data, display a specific state and its data, create a bar graph comparing the top 5 states populations, or update the population of a state. The program uses the states.txt file and flowers folder to create the list of states in the program.
